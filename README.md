## 🛠️ Technologies Introduced

- **ERD Tools**: dbdiagram.io, drawSQL
- **AI Tools**: ChatGPT for research and debugging
- **Platforms**: LinkedIn, GitHub

## 📚 Week 2 – Advanced SQL & Python Generators

### 🔍 Focus Areas
- **SQL Mastery**: Deep dive into advanced SQL queries and performance optimization.
- **Python Generators & Asynchronous Programming**: Mastering memory-efficient patterns and async workflows.
- **Milestone 1**: Initial setup and database configuration for the AirBnB Clone backend.

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings

#### 🧮 Advanced SQL (Querying Power)
- Practiced writing **complex queries** using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, subqueries, and window functions.
- Understood the importance of **indexing** and query optimization for large datasets.
- Learned how to analyze query performance using `EXPLAIN` and improve runtime.

#### 🐍 Python Generators
- Discovered how **generators** enable memory-efficient iteration over large datasets.
- Used `yield` to create simple generators, and chained them for lazy processing.
- Understood when to prefer **generators over lists** in real backend use cases.

#### ⚙️ Asynchronous Programming
- Gained foundational knowledge of **async I/O** in Python using `async def` and `await`.
- Understood how **asynchronous workflows** help with high-concurrency backends (e.g., API handling).
- Explored concepts of **event loops** and cooperative multitasking.

#### 🧱 Milestone 1 – Project Setup
- Set up a fully working backend environment using Django.
- Created and configured PostgreSQL database for the AirBnB Clone.
- Established consistent environment using `.env` files and `docker-compose`.

---

### 🚧 Challenges Faced
- Encountered difficulties optimizing nested SQL queries for speed.

---

### ✅ Solutions Implemented
- Revisited SQL execution plans and practiced on real-world data sets to better understand indexes.
- Built small async Python programs to isolate and master async concepts.
- Collaborated with peers during PLDs for feedback on SQL query structures.

---

### 🌟 Personal Takeaways
- SQL is not just about retrieving data—**it's about doing it efficiently**.
- Generators and async programming are powerful tools to **scale backend systems**.
- Investing time in project setup and environment configuration pays off later.
